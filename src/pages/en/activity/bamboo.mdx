On September 17th, our team went to the Nature Miffy Workshop to make a basket out of bamboo. The Nature Miffy Workshop is the same as the one we interviewed. When we visited them, we were amazed by the delicate bamboo weaving handwork in the workshop. During the interview, we also witnessed how the owners persist in living a plastic-free life by making their daily necessities with environmental friendly materials in spite of the rapid advancement in technology. Their dedication also makes us want to experience this time-consuming yet valuable bamboo weaving activity, hoping to arouse people's attention to the environment and taking practical actions to decelerate climate change. By carefully interlacing and aligning the individual bamboo strips, each one of us successfully made a bamboo basket.

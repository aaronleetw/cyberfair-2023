In recent years, people are in a desperate pursuit of efficiency and convenience in production. The cost of plastic and its speed in manufacturing has allowed the material to become every factory’s favorite. However, it worsens pollution day by day. Under the sea, plastic is the criminal who killed hundreds of lives. Coral reef is no exception. Pieces of broken plastic waste are like rusty knives. If coral reef accidentally get entangled with a plastic bag, it could easily get sick and eventually doe. Cases in which coral reef is injured by plastic bad is not rare. According to Environmental Information Center, “Researchers estimated that the frequency of plastic pollution involved with coral reef around Asia-Pacific would increase by 40% if no actions taken.”

Compared to shops that ignores the importance of environment in the name of profit, Naturemiffy is unique in that they stress using natural raw material only. Their products include wooden spoon, cloth-made sanitary pad, etc. The word “plastic” doesn’t seem to belong to their vocabulary. These daily necessities made with purely natural materials also adds to the warmth and cordiality. The shop’s persistence in using raw materials with higher cost to replace plastic saves lives from being disturbed, injured, or even killed by plastic trash. In other words, they use that extra cost in exchange to of a healthier ecosystem. For those reasons, our team wants to interview the shop in hope of learning to use environmentally-friendly materials for daily necessities.
